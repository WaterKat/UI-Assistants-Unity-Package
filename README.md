# UI-Assistants-Unity-Package [DEPRECATED]
ALL functionality has been merged into the com.waterkat.core package.

This package allows you to create UIAssistant objects that will ease the creation of OnGUI() UI in unity. 
While unity contains their own EDITORGUILAYOUT or GUILAYOUT, it's still more complicated than needed to create normal OnGui() formatting.
